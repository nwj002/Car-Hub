## Tools and Technologies

CarHub is developed using state-of-the-art tools and technologies to ensure a seamless user experience:

- **Android Studio:** The application is built using Android Studio, the official integrated development environment for Android app development.

- **Firebase:** We utilize Firebase for real-time database management, user authentication, and cloud storage. This ensures smooth user interactions and data management.

- **Figma:** Our design process involves Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. This enables us to create visually appealing and user-centric interfaces.

- **Visual Studio Code:** The codebase is crafted and maintained using Visual Studio Code, a lightweight yet powerful code editor.

## MVVM Pattern

CarHub follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to separate the application's concerns and enhance maintainability. This pattern ensures clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and data handling.
